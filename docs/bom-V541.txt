Talking SWR Meter – Bill of Materials (BOM)
Version 5.4.1

Main Components
---------------
1x ESP32-S3 Development Board

Tested boards:
- esp32-s3-dev-kit-nxr8 with esp32-s3-wroom-1 chip
- esp32-s3-dev-board with esp32-s3-n16r8

Ensure that:
- GPIO1 and GPIO2 are ADC-capable (forward / reflected power)
- GPIO4, GPIO5, GPIO6, and GPIO7 are available for I²S output
- GPIO9 can be used as an ADC input (button ladder)
- GPIO8 supports LEDC PWM (buzzer)
- The board can boot normally without conflicts on these pins

1x RF Directional Coupler / SWR Bridge (50 Ω, with FWD/REV DC outputs)

Tested couplers:
- 100 W Tandem Match SWR bridge from 60dbm.com
- Wavenode HF-Sensor 1.6 – 40 MHz, up to 2 kW

1x MAX98357A I²S Audio Amplifier Module
1x Loudspeaker, 4–8 Ω, 1–3 W
1x Buzzer (active or passive, PWM-driven)
1x DC/DC Step-Down Converter (e.g. LM2596), 13.8 V → 5 V

Button Ladder (6 Keys on One ADC Pin)
------------------------------------
6x Momentary push buttons
