Talking SWR Meter – Bill of Materials (BOM)
Version 4.5

Main Components
---------------
1x ESP32-S3 Development Board
tested boards:
esp32-s3-dev-kit-nxr8 with esp32-s3-wroom-1 chip
esp32-s3-dev-board with esp32-s3-n16r8
ensure that:
- GPIO 1 and GPIO 2 are ADC-capable  
- GPIO 4, 5, 6, and 7 are available for I²S output  
- GPIO 9 can be used as an ADC input (button ladder)  
- GPIO 8 supports LEDC PWM  
- Board can boot normally without conflicts on these pins

1x RF Directional Coupler / SWR Bridge (50 Ω, with FWD/REV outputs)
tested:
100W Tandem Match SWR bridge from 60dbm.com
Wavenode HF-Sensor 1.6 - 40 MHz, 2 kW

1x MAX98357A I²S Audio Amplifier Module
1x 4–8 Ω Speaker (1–3 W)
1x Buzzer (active or passive)
1x DC/DC Step-Down Converter (e.g. LM2596), 13.8 V → 5 V

Button Ladder (6 keys)
-----------------------
6x Momentary Push Buttons (T1..T6)
1x 10 kΩ resistor (pull-up to 3.3 V)
1x 1 kΩ resistor  (R1 → T1 → GND)
1x 2.2 kΩ resistor (R2 → T2 → GND)
1x 4.7 kΩ resistor (R3 → T3 → GND)
1x 10 kΩ resistor  (R4 → T4 → GND)
1x 22 kΩ resistor  (R5 → T5 → GND)
1x 47 kΩ resistor  (R6 → T6 → GND)

Power and RF
-------------
1x 13.8 V station power supply
1x DC input connector
2x RF connectors (SO-239, N, PL, BNC – depend on your coupler)
Coax cables for TX → SWR bridge → Antenna

Miscellaneous
--------------
Enclosure / case
Perfboard or small PCB
Wiring, headers, connectors
Tactile / braille labels
Screws and mounting hardware

Notes
------
This BOM corresponds to firmware version 4.5.
Values of resistors for the button ladder may be adapted to hardware.
All module grounds must be connected together.
